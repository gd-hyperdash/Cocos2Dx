# Cocos2Dx

This repo contains the header files necessary to interface with [cocos2d-x](https://www.cocos.com/en/cocos2dx), the engine used by Geometry Dash. The headers are modified to comply with RobTop's edits; therefore, they might not be 100% accurate. Any issue should be reported in the appropriate [tab](https://github.com/gd-hyperdash/Cocos2Dx/issues).
